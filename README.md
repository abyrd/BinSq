# BinSq
Gridded dot map technique for tackling visual clutter in discrete geographic data.

This is a rudimentary implementation of BinSq in processing-java for release alongside our publication. Processing (see [http://www.processing.org](http://www.processing.org)) is required to compile this version. Files with *.java* extension will be part of a larger geotools package to be released in the near future.

Please read our paper for complete description of the algorithm.
