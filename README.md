# BinSq
Gridded dot map technique for tackling visual clutter in discrete geographic data.

This is a rudimentary implementation of BinSq in processing-java for release alongside our publication. Processing (see [http://www.processing.org](http://www.processing.org)) is required to compile this version. Files with *.java* extension will be part of a larger geotools package to be released in the near future.

The key components of the technique are illustrated in the image above. Please read our paper for complete description of the algorithm.
